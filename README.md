In this task a weighted, unintentional graph is realized, we will perform actions on the graph such as adding a vertex or a side, and deleting them. In addition, a calculation of the path with the least weight between two vertices is realized.
In this task I used dijkstra's algorithm for calculation the path with the least weight between two vertices is realized.
